2M (A Meal and a Memory) is a food donation portal designed to bridge the gap between surplus food and those in need.
It allows donors to contribute meals easily, view recent donations, and spread kindness with just a few clicks.
The project was developed as part of my Final Year Project, with a focus on social impact, clean UI, and practical usability.
